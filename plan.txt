Plan:

Create an app where customers can select a type of product (e.g meat, eggs, milk etc.) and results for local producers selling the product appear in a table (max 10)
in order of distance descending. Producers can add their products to the database for customers to select. 
In order:
CREATE TABLES
Register users with name, email, password, county, postcode - create users table.
Create homepage
Create sell page with transactions table (user, product, price, time, county, postcode)
Create buy page with same transactions table
